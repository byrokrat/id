STB is a collection of classes useful when processing data related to swedish 
bureaucracy and banking systems. The functionality is split into different
subpackages.

Installation using composer
---------------------------
The usage of [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) is recommended. Simply add
`iio/stb` to your list of required libraries.


Accounting
----------
The accounting subpackage handles bookkeeping data. Specifically transaction
data can be read and written in the SIE format. Accounting templates from the
VISMA series of accounting software is also supported.


Banking
-------
Data types for accounts in the swedish banking system. Se `BankAccountFactory` for
a way to transparently create account objects.

### Creating bank account objects

    use iio\stb\Banking\BankAccountFactory;
    $account = BankAccountFactory::create('3300,1111111116');
    // $account is an instance of iio\stb\Banking\NordeaPerson


Billing
-------
Invoice and support classes. `InvoicePost` represents a purchased item.

    // 1 unit of a 100 EUR item with 25% VAT
    $item = new InvoicePost(
        'Item description',
        new Amount('1'),
        new Amount('100'),
        new Amount('.25')
    );

The simplest way to create invoices is by using the `InvoiceBuilder`.

    $builder = new InvoiceBuilder();

    $invoice = $builder->reset()
        ->setSerial('1')
        ->generateOCR()
        ->setSeller(new LegalPerson('Company X', ...))
        ->setBuyer(new LegalPerson('Mrs Y', ...))
        ->setMessage('Pay in time or else!')
        ->setCurrency('EUR')
        ->addPost($item)
        ->getInvoice();

`Invoice` represents the actual invoice. Se the class definition for a complete
list of access methods.

    echo $invoice->getInvoiceTotal();
    // prints 125 (100 EUR plus 25% VAT)


ID
--
Data types for swedish social security and corporation id numbers.

### PersonalId

Personal id is presented here as an example of what you can do with the id objects.

    use iio\stb\ID\PersonalId;
    $id = new PersonalId('820323-2775');
    echo $id->getId();                      //820323-2775
    echo $id->getLondId();                  //19820323-2775
    echo $id->getDate()->format('Y-m-d');   //1982-03-23
    echo $id->getSex();                     //M

### Creating ID objects

Creating ID objects can be comlicated.

* A personal id can be a coordination id, if the personal identified as not a
swedish citicen.
* A corporation id can be a personal id if the corporation is registered with a
single individual (egenfÃ¶retagare).
* A single individual company can use a coordination id if the individual is
not a swedish citicen.
* At times you may wish to process persons without a valid swedish personal id,
using the FakeId implementation.

To solve these difficulties a decoratable IdFactory is included. Create a factory
with the abilities you need by chaining factory objects at creation time.

    $factory = new PersonalIdFactory(new CoordinationIdFactory());
    $id = $factory->create('some id...');

In this example the factory will first try to create a PersonalId, if this fails
it will try to create a CoordinationId, if this fails it will throw an Exception.


Utils
-----
Some utility classes.
 
 * `Amount` represent transaction amounts using bcmath for arithmetic precision.
 
 * `OCR` represents transaction numbers used in the swedish banking system.


Continuous integration
----------------------
Running unit tests and other code analysis tools can be handled using `phing`.
To run CI tests type `phing` from the project root directory, point your browser
to `build/index.html` to view the results.


Running unit tests
------------------
From project root simply type

    > phpunit
